# Web Data Extractor using Regular Expressions

## Project Overview

This project is a **Web Data Extractor** that uses **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to extract structured information from unstructured text. It is designed to process large amounts of textual data and extract key elements such as:

- **Email Addresses**
- **URLs**
- **Phone Numbers**
- **Credit Card Numbers**
- **Time Formats (12-hour & 24-hour formats)**

The extracted data can be used for further processing in applications like **data validation, content filtering, and automated analysis**.

## Features

âœ… Extracts multiple data formats using optimized Regex patterns\
âœ… Handles various edge cases and malformed input data\
âœ… Provides clean, structured outputs for easy analysis\
âœ… Includes validation mechanisms to ensure high accuracy\
âœ… Fully documented and structured for team collaboration

Extracted Credit Cards: ['1234 5678 9012 3456', '1234-5678-9012-3456']
Extracted Time: ['14:30', '2:30 PM']
```
